            <p>Ever wanted to be invisible for the rest of your life? Run this class!</p>
            <p>With Omnioculus and/or Gyrfalcon's
                Hauberk, this class will make you never seen again!</p>
            <p>*This build is mostly for late/end game PVE content (GM Nightfalls, Legendary dungeons, raids, etc.).</p>
            <p>**Really not good for PVP content.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Weapons</h3>
        <p>A few weapons that will really make you invisible!</p>
        <ul>
            <h5 class="title">Kinetic Slot</h5>
            <li>Run some champion stunner (Wish-ender, Arbalest, etc. for exotics).</li>
            <li>Any non-exotic stunner will work, probably.</li>

            <h5 class="title">Energy Slot</h5>
            <li>If no exotic in Kinetic, this is where the fun begins.</li>
            <li>Wavesplitter is wonderful for applying suppression and getting some juicy resets.</li>
            <li>Lemon Arque is great for AOE and staying the hell away from the big boys.</li>
            <li>If exotic in Kinetic, just run some void stunner.</li>
            <li>Legendary Void trace rifle exists, but it kinda sucks.</li>

            <h5 class="title">Heavy Slot</h5>
            <li>Any void hard hitting heavy weapon (LFR, Rockets, maybe even a <strong>HEAVY MACHINE GUN</strong>).</li>
            <li>Currently running Braytech Osprey with some auto reload (Autoloading and envious assassin are my main
                two).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title">Armor</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Gyrfalcon's Hauberk for gigachad volatile AOE. Could even get a nice overshield and damage boost if you
                finish an enemy while invisible.</li>
            <li>Omnioculus for very safe and LOTS OF invisible saves. Teammates will really like you.</li>
            <li>For armor slots, focus on melee and class ability reduction. Grenade is whatever.</li>
            <li>Always make sure to grab elemental resistance on chest. Grandmaster Nightfalls are no joke.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title">Aspects and Fragments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h5 class="title">Stylish Executioner</h5>
            </li>
            <li>Focus on going invisible over and over again from ad clearing.</li>
            <li>More gigachad playstyle, but not as consistent since you need to kill things for invisible.</li>
            <li>Pair with Gyrfalcon's Hauberk for very long invisibility times.</li>

            <li>
                <h5 class="title">Vanishing Step</h5>
            </li>
            <li>Very consistent invisibility.</li>
            <li>Pair with Stylish Executioner for easy Gyrfalcon's Hauberk resets.</li>
            <li>Pair with Trapper's Ambush for more team invisibility.</li>
            <li>
                <h5 class="title">Trapper's Ambush</h5>
            </li>
            <li>The bread and butter of Omnioculus.</li>
            <li>Make you and your teammates tankier in general.</li>
            <li>Revive and invis your teammates for safe consistent gameplay.</li>
            <li>Remember, the damage resistance only happens while invisible, so the moment you or your teammates shoot,
                they are back to squishy.</li>
            <li>If you really don't want to play aggressive, just play back with a long-range weapon and revive your
                teammates.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title">Playstyle</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Focus on ad clearing, stay pretty far back from most of the action.</li>
            <li>You can be aggressive, but the moment your resources are on cooldown, you're a sitting duck for
                oneshots.</li>
            <li>Tip: When reviving teammates, jump and use Trapper's Ambush at ~80% full. You'll invis yourself and your
                teammate while also giving the damage resistance for much safer repositioning.</li>
            <li>Omnioculus allows for a lot of restealth if you stealth 2 or more teammates at a time.</li>
            <li>You cannot restealth teammates if they are already invisible, meaning your melee won't come back as
                fast.</li>
        </ul>
